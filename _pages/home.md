## Welcome to CHI SIRD 2026!

Gender-based online harm has become a global problem due to
technological advances and affordances. Despite an increasing interest in designing technical and legal interventions in tackling
online harm, the level of online violence against women and girls
remains high. Responsible design plays a pivotal role in mitigating
technological harms, and it has particularly captured attention in
the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

This workshop aims to use the sociotechnical imaginary framework to bring together HCI researchers, developers, and practitioners across domains and sectors to collectively reflect and envision how responsible design can address gender-based online harm. Through facilitated hands-on activities, participants will explore how new approaches, paradigms,
technologies, and mechanisms can be designed and implemented to
better understand the responsibility in responsible design. This will
also help the HCI community understand how to put responsible
design into practice and shape the future of responsible technology
that prevents gender-based online harms.
