## Workshop Organisers

Our team of organizers represent experts in online harms, personal
safety, psychology, design, methodology, misinformation, responsible software engineering, pro-social computing, social engineering, and enterprise design thinking, from both academic and industrybackgrounds. Each organizer brings unique expertise, experience,
and vision to the workshop. Our team has extensive workshop
organizational experience in user experience, responsible software
engineering, design, applied psychology, ethics, and knowledge
modeling.

**Min Zhang (workshop lead)** is a Lecturer at the Open
University and the Centre for Protecting Women Online. Her work
focuses on the future of responsible technology in preventing gendered online harm, personal safety, and the collective power of community, and how to design safe, positive, and inclusive online
spaces to not only combat online harm, but also promote online
positivity, such as positive masculinity. She serves as the program
committee for several ACM conferences, workshops, and IFIP WG
13.11/12.14.

**Arosha Bandara** is a Professor of Software Engineering at The
Open University whose research and teaching focus on software
engineering for adaptive systems. He has a particular interest in
techniques for building responsible, adaptive security and privacy
mechanisms for software-intensive socio-technical systems. His
work has been applied in diverse domains, including healthcare
and policing. He is a member of the steering group for the OU’s
Centre for Policing Research and Learning.

**Gordon Rugg** is a specialist in methods for handling knowledge
that people find difficult or impossible to put into words. He has
a multidisciplinary background, including a PhD in Psychology,
and postdoctoral work in knowledge acquisition for AI and for
requirements engineering. His interests include cross-cultural re-
search and User-Centered Design. He has experience in running
knowledge elicitation and systematic idea generation workshops by
using multiple approaches, such as card sorting, upward laddering,
and think-aloud. He is a co-author of the books The Knowledge
Modelling Handbook and The Unwritten Rules of PhD Research.

**Irum Rauf** is a Lecturer at The Open University, UK. She is also
involved in research on Responsible Software Engineering at Lero,
the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Software. Her
research focuses on the intersection of technology and society, par-
ticularly on creating technology that can empower people and com-
munities. She investigates the unintended societal consequences
of technology and explores approaches to mitigate its negative ef-
fects on users and society. She is interested in transdisciplinary
research and has worked in multi-disciplinary, multi-generational,
and multi-national teams.

**Dilrukshi Gamage** is a Senior Lecturer at the University of
Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) in Sri Lanka. She is exploring AI-generated content harms from the Global South, particularly
South Asia. She has extensive experience in organizing CHI workshops, especially relating to building tools for credibility indicators
and Feminist voices of ecological issues. She serves on the Asian
CHI steering committee and also SIGCHI Colombo in promoting
HCI in the Asian Context.

**Bashar Nuseibeh** is Professor of Computing at the Open University, where he leads the Software Engineering and Design Group. His research interests include requirements engineering, adaptive
security and privacy, and psychosocial factors in software design.
Bashar has chaired and organised many international conferences,
including co-chairing the first international workshop on responsible software engineering. He is currently UKRI’s Research Pillar
Chair for Responsible AI – the UK’s flagship research programme
in the area.

**Wanling Cai** is a postdoctoral researcher at Trinity College
Dublin and a researcher at Lero, the Science Foundation Ireland
Research Centre for Software, Ireland. She is also an incoming
Assistant Professor at University College Dublin. Her research lies
at the intersection of HCI and AI, investigating the issues surround-
ing the use of interactive technologies (e.g., recommender systems,
conversational AI, generative AI, and wearables) in everyday life
and healthcare contexts. She has served on the program and or-
ganization committees of several ACM conferences, such as IUI,
RecSys, UMAP, and MUM.

**Silvia Podesta** is an advisory innovation designer and Business Technology Leader at IBM. With a strong grounding in user-centered design and a track record in digital strategy, product development, and customer experience, she helps clients to bridge
design, technology, and governance to implement responsible and
strategically impactful AI. She has authored a book on digital design strategy and co-authored a paper on trustworthy AI design for process transformation in a media and journalism use case.

**Sarah Robinson** is an Applied Psychologist, working at the
School of Applied Social Studies, UCC, and at Lero, the Science
Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Software. She has an in-
terest in responsible design and engineering, community-based
research, creative methods, and children. She has co-organized
workshops for DIS and other venues.
